Project Description – Linear ODE Solver (Without Mathematical Terms)

The Linear ODE Solver is a computer program made to help users find the values of a changing quantity step by step. It is mainly designed for students and beginners to understand how computer programs can be used to solve problems that change over time.

In this project, the user enters some starting values and a step size. The program then calculates the next values one by one and shows them in a clear table format. This makes it easier to see how the value changes as the input increases.

The main aim of this project is to reduce manual work and avoid mistakes that can happen during hand calculations. It also helps users learn how numerical methods work in a simple and practical way.

This project is useful for educational purposes, especially for students of Engineering Mathematics and Computer Science. It also improves logical thinking and programming skills by combining theory with practical implementation.

Since the program is simple and user-friendly, it can be used by anyone who has basic knowledge of computers and programming.
mportant Points

Always enter valid numeric values.

The step size should be small for more accurate results.

Make sure the program is compiled without errors before running.

Do not leave any input blank.
